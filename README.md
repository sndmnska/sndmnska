- 👋 Hi, I’m @sndmnska.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanded python projects. I've just come out of a basic python course and am itching to start putting my newfound skills to the test. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a Software Development A.A.S. at Minneapolis Community and Techincal College. My overall goal is to become educated enough to have a Master's degree someday.  The more I learn, the more I really enjoy coding and computers. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on starting projects on the side to keep honing/maintaining my programming skillset. 
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.smeiskaudio.com/contact
